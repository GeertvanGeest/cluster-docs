If you are organizing a course that requires cluster resources, please contact our IT Team (it@bioinformatics.unibe.ch) well in advance (five weeks recommended), and provide him with the following information:

- When is the course happening? (From-To)
- do the students need an IBU Account by their name or will you use generic students* accounts ?
- how many students* accounts are needed and by which date ?
- who are the teachers: provide an excel or tabulation-separated list with :

1. IBU username if existing
2. First Name
3. Last Name
4. Email address
5. PI (username or email address)
  
- if students needs an account with their real name, who are the students ?  Provide an excel or tabulation-separated list with :

1. IBU username if existing
2. First Name
3. Last Name
4. Email address
5. PI (username or email address)
  
- where should data be stored ?

1. path on /data/courses or /home or /data/users or ?
2. how much data in GB where 
3. who should have read-only access to which data
4. who should have read-and-write access to which data
  
- How many CPUs do you need reserved for the course ?  are 128 CPUS enough ?
- How much RAM needed ? Is 512 GB RAM enough for the reserved partition ?
- How long should the course data be retained ?
- how long should the students accounts remain valid ?
- do the students need to access the HPC resources (storage, slurm partition) after the end of the course and if yes until when ?
- provide a cell phone emergency number for me to call one of the teachers in case of problems with the setup.  Who is that ?
- Who should have my phone number for emergencies.  Emergency communication please only by phone, no email.
- When should I be available for emergencies?  Date, Time From-To.
- please ask the students to test their access to HPC and to the storage folder before the course starts

Experience shows that Emergency Communication is most needed, but preparation thereof very much neglected.  If I do not get that info, I will not be able to organize and provide help when you will really need it.
