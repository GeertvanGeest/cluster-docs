If you are organizing a course that requires cluster resources, please contact [it@bioinformatics.unibe.ch](mailto:it@bioinformatics.unibe.ch) and provide the following information as soon as possible.

>We need to know _at least two months in advance_ the dates of the course in order to reserve the resources and make sure there is no overlap with maintenance.  We need to know about each course, even it is recurring every year.

- When is the course happening? (From-To)
- do the students need an IBU Account by their name or will you use students* accounts ?
- how many students* accounts are needed and by which date ?
- who are the teachers: provide an excel or tabulation-separated list with :

1. IBU username if existing
2. First Name
3. Last Name

- where should data be stored ?

1. path on /data/courses or /home or /data/users or ?
2. how much data in GB where 
3. who should have read-only access to which data

- How many CPUs do you need reserved for the course ?  are 128 CPUS enough ?
- How much RAM needed ? Is 512 GB RAM enough for the reserved partition ?
- How long should the course data be retained ?
