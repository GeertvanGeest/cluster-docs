### Principle of SSH
  ### encrypted channel
    - secure channel over unsecured network

### cryptography
 ### asymmetric cryptography (private/public keys pair): server and user authentication
 ### key exchange algorithm , symmetric cryptography: encryption of secured channel


### Host authentication

### User authentication:
  - password
  - public key
  
### Public keys best practices
  - Verify host key
  - storage host keys
  - generate
  - store encrypted
  - ssh-copy-id
  - permissions of authorized_keys
