## RStudio Server

This will create a user-specific session and you will need to install all non-default packages (note: packages are installed in user libraries)  
https://rstudio.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/users/$USER\_NAME/ (Do not forget the “/” at the end)

*   To link RStudio server to the filesystem:
*   create an `RSTUDIO` directory in the project root (e.g. `/data/projects/$PROJECT_ID/`) or at the user level  (`/data/users/$USERNAME/)`
*   the folder will appear in your RStudio home directory (check the files pane). Note: this may take up to 10&#39; (worst case scenario)
