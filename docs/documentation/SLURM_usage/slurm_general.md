## Introduction

A cluster has many resources and many users. Often the demand for resources is higher than supply. A job scheduler can schedule the jobs submitted by the different users, based on priority, required resources and time. The IBU cluster uses [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com) as job scheduler. After submitting a job to the cluster, SLURM will try to fulfill the job's resource request by allocating resources to the job.
