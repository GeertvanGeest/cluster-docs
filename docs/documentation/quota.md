## Information about your &quot;personal&quot; quota on /home and /data/users:

```sh
lsquota
```

&quot;For example, in this output you can see that I have exceeded my soft-quota in Gigabytes on /data/users (look at the \*) and I have got 7days to  
clean up. If I do not clean up within these 7 days, I will no longer be able to write new data to these folders.&quot;
